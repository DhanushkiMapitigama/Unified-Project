# Unified-Project
Flood detection and safety prediction system through water level and velocity monitoring

Hardware components:
Arduino board
GSM module
Ultrasonic sensor
Flow rate sensor
Solar rechargeable power supply

Captured signals would be transmitted to a centralized server.

Centralized server:
Database
Mobile app
Web interfaces

Network traffic handling, flow control are considered.
Security aspects:
Third party cannot access server, no attackers can manipulate data within the database. steps should also be taken to avoid an outsider behaving as a node of the system and corrupting the data.
